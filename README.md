# IT-Helpdesk-Ticket-Classification

## Product overview

A high frequency of issues can generate an overwhelming number of help desk tickets and incorrect delegation to teams to handle them. This leads to a spike in MTTR (mean time taken to resolve) and a dip in FCR (First Call Resolution). The solution mitigates these issues by training a multi-factor ML model that considers factors like ticket impact, urgency, priority, issue description and other features to predict the most relevant group to resolve a ticket. A pool of models is run through data to select the most generalizable model for the ticket classification task.

## Product Highlight 

* The solution uses NLP to process ticket descriptions stored in free text form to generate help desk ticket specific features and granularizing the information content. This allows for better differentiation between ticket types and their mapping to resolution teams.
* The solution supports customization of input fields by the user to address variability of ticketing information captured by the businesses. The solution allows for optional fields to handle such customization.
* Mphasis Optimize.AI is an AI-centric process analysis and optimization tool that uses AI/ML techniques to mine the event logs to deliver business insights. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch!
